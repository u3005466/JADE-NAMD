NSTATE = Number of states to be found (excluding the
         reference state).  The default is 1 more state.

IROOT  = State used for geometry optimization and property
         evaluation. (default=1)
         TDDFT=EXCITE counts the reference as 0, and this
         should be the lowest state.  Hence IROOT=1 means
         the 1st excited state, just as you might guess.
         TDDFT=SPNFLP labels the reference state as 0, but
         this might not be the lowest state overall.  The
         meaning of IROOT=1 is the lowest state, omitting
         the reference state from consideration.  Hence
         IROOT=1 might specify the ground state!

MULT   = Multiplicity (1 or 3) of the singly excited
         states.  This keyword applies only when the
         reference is a closed shell.  (default is 1)
         This parameter is ignored when TDDFT=SPNFLP.



AMMD    is a flag selecting the Tamm/Dancoff approximation
         be used.  This may be used with closed shell
         excitation energies or gradients, or open shell
         excitation energies.  Default = .FALSE.
         This parameter is ignored by TDDFT=SPNFLP, which
         is only coded in the Tamm/Dancoff approximation.

NSTATE = Number of CI states to be found, including the
         ground state.  The default is 1, meaning ground
         state only.  The maximum number of states is 100.
         See also IROOT below (two places).

PRTTOL = Printout tolerance for CI coefficients, the
         default is to print any larger than 0.05.
